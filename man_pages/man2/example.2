[1mNAME[0m
       example - an example program

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mexample[0m -k -W [[3moptions[0m] argument blah

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This is a fake example program.  The command line switches, options, and
       arguments don't actually exist since this is just an example.
       
       This text is in a new paragraph.  Blank lines should also be output.
       So this [4mparagraph[0m should have a blank line before it.
       You should see [1mbold[0m, [3mitalic[0m, and [4munderline[0m and
       these can be [1m[3m[4mcombined[0m.  You can also output /fP characters.
       
       Typical man pages will have a NAME section, a SYNOPSIS section,
       and a DESCRIPTION section (at least).  The NAME and DESCRIPTION
       sections are important for the apropos program.

[1mOTHER[0m
       Words from this section should not be searched when using wapropos.
       That is also true for all other sections except NAME and DESCRIPTION.
       I've put the word 'blah' in this section and in the SYNPOSIS section
       of this page and in the example(1) page but in the DESCRIPTION section.
       So when you search for that, you should only see example(1) but if you
       search for something else (say fake) then you should see both.
