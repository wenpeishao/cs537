[1mNAME[0m
       example - an example program

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mexample[0m -k -W [[3moptions[0m] argument

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This is a fake example program.  The command line switches, options, and
       arguments don't actually exist since this is just an example.
       
       This text is in a new paragraph.  Blank lines should also be output.
       So this [4mparagraph[0m should have a blank line before it.
       You should see [1mbold[0m, [3mitalic[0m, and [4munderline[0m and
       these can be [1m[3m[4mcombined[0m.  You can also output /fP characters.
       
       Typical man pages will have a NAME section, a SYNOPSIS section,
       and a DESCRIPTION section (at least).  The NAME and DESCRIPTION
       sections are important for the apropos program.
