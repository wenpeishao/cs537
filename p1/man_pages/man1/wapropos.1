[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mwapropos[0m is a simplified version of apropos for use with
       wman and wgroff.  It searches the manual found in ./man_pages
       for the user-provided [4mkeyword[0m.
       
       [4mkeyword[0m is a single word (i.e. no spaces) and must be found in
       either the NAME section or the DESCRIPTION section of the manual pages.
       
       The output of this program is a list of all manual pages (with their
       section) that contain the keyword.  The list should be ordered with pages
       found in lower sections before pages found in higher sections.  The list
       also contains the one-line of information after the dash in the NAME section.
       
       If no keyword is given the program should print "wapropos what?\n" and exit.
       If no pages contain the keyword then print "nothing appropriate\n" and exit.
       
       Here is an example run:
       
       ./wapropos simplified
       
       The output would look like:
       
       wman (1) - a simplified manual program
       wgroff (1) - simplified document formatting system
       wapropos (1) - a simplified program to search manual page names and descriptions
