.SH name
example - an example program
.SH SYNOPSIS
#example comment
/fBexample/fP -k -W [/fIoptions/fP] argument blah
.SH Description
This is a fake example program.  The command line switches, options, and
arguments don't actually exist since this is just an example.

This text is in a new paragraph.  Blank lines should also be output.
So this /fUparagraph/fP should have a blank line before it.
You should see /fBbold/fP, /fIitalic/fP, and /fUunderline/fP and
these can be /fB/fI/fUcombined/fP.  You can also output // characters.

Typical man pages will have a NAME section, a SYNOPSIS section,
and a DESCRIPTION section (at least).  The NAME and DESCRIPTION
sections are important for the apropos program.
.SH other
Words from this section should not be searched when using wapropos.
That is also true for all other sections except NAME and DESCRIPTION.
I've put the word 'blah' in this section and in the SYNPOSIS section
of this page and in the example(1) page but in the DESCRIPTION section.
So when you search for that, you should only see example(1) but if you
search for something else (say fake) then you should see both.
